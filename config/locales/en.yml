      app_description: As a civic tech organization, JumpStart often tries to find solutions to these sorts of transparency shortcomings and we often use technology to do it. This year, JumpStart is building a web-based tool that enables anyone to help us take the precinct information, which is uploaded to the CEC's website in the form of scanned documents, and digitize it so that organizations can then analyze it in time to have an impact - before the outcome of the elections has been decided. With the support of the National Democratic Institute and volunteers in Georgia and all over the world, JumpStart is spearheading a massive effort to digitize all the precinct information within 48 hours after polling stations close.

          JumpStart welcomes any and all support for this effort, including YOUR time. By volunteering your time to digitize even a small number of precinct ballot protocols, you will help us achieve our goal. The data will be available to everyone for download throughout the night in spreadsheet format and will regularly feed into the <a href="http://elections.jumpstart.ge/" target="_blank">Georgian Election Data Portal</a> to make it easy for people to explore, visually, what the data means.

          To help us ensure your vote counts, help us count.

      explanations:
        region: The name of the region. Before 2016, the election districts matched the geographic districts and so it was possible to know what region the district was in. However, in 2016, election districts were merged and split, so now the election districts do not follow the region boundaries and so it is not possible to assign a region name any more.
        district_id: The ID of the district. In the new naming scheme introduced in 2016 (i.e., 01.23.45), the first two numbers are the district ID (i.e., 01), also known as the majoritarian district ID.
        district_name: The name of the district. Before 2016, the election districts matched the geographic districts in the country and the names were used to identify these districts. However, in 2016, election districts were merged and split so now the district name is the same as the district ID.
        precinct_id: The ID of the precinct. In the new naming scheme introduced in 2016 (i.e., 01.23.45), the last two set of numbers are the precinct ID (i.e., 23.45).
        attached_precinct_id: ''
        num_possible_voters: 'The number of registered voters in the precinct. This number comes from item #1 in the protocol.'
        num_special_voters: 'The number of registered special voters in the precinct. This number comes from item #2 in the protocol.'
        num_at_12: 'The number of people that voted by 12:00 in the precinct. This number comes from item #3ა in the protocol.'
        num_at_17: 'The number of people that voted by 17:00 in the precinct. This number comes from item #3ბ in the protocol.'
        num_votes: 'The number of ballots submitted by voters in the precinct. This number comes from item #4 in the protocol.'
        num_ballots: 'The number of ballots the precincts were given. This number comes from item #5 in the protocol.'
        num_invalid_votes: 'The number of ballots that were marked as invalid by the precinct staff. This number comes from item #6 in the protocol.'
        num_valid_votes: This number is calculated by adding all of the party votes and subtracting 'num_invalid_votes'.
        logic_check_fail: This is a flag that indicates whether the 'num_votes' = 'num_valid_votes'. Ideally, these values should match. 0 = they do match. 1 = they do not match.
        logic_check_difference: This is a calculation of 'num_votes' - 'num_valid_votes'. Ideally, this should be 0.
        more_ballots_than_votes_flag: This is a flag that indicates whether there are more ballots submitted then votes for parties. The calculation is 'num_valid_votes' > sum of the party votes. Ideally, these values should match. 0 = they do match. 1 = they do not match.
        more_ballots_than_votes: This is a calculation of 'num_valid_votes' - sum of the party votes. Ideally, this should be 0.
        more_votes_than_ballots_flag: This is a flag that indicates whether there are more votes for parties than ballots submitted. The calculation is sum of the party votes > 'num_valid_votes'. Ideally, these values should match. 0 = they do match. 1 = they do not match.
        more_votes_than_ballots: This is a calculation of sum of the party votes - 'num_valid_votes'. Ideally, this should be 0.
        amendments_flag: This a flag that indicates whether amendments have been submitted to the original protocol. 0 = no. 1 = yes.
        amendment_count: This number shows how many amendments have been submitted.
        is_annulled: This is a flag that indicates whether the votes in this precinct have been annulled. View the protocol amendment to learn why. 0 = no. 1 = yes.

      subject: Are you ready to help JumpStart digitize some election protocols?!
      message: |
        Dear volunteer,

        The time is come to help JumpStart make Georgian Parliamentary election data transparent! We appreciate you efforts to digitize the protocols, making the analysis of the election data more interesting.

        Below are some instructions to get you started.

        First you will need to go to the website:

        <a href="https://protocols.jumpstart.ge">https://protocols.jumpstart.ge</a>

        Your login information is as follows:

        username: %{email}
        password: %{password}

        Once you log in, you should click on the blue button "Training". This will help you familiarize yourself with how the protocols look and how to fill out the form. You must complete 5 protocols successfully before you can start digitizing real protocols. Don't worry, it is really easy.

        Once you have completed the training, you will be able to start digitizing real protocols. There are a lot of them, but that is what we are here for.

        Take your time at first, you will eventually speed up. There are several helpful controls at the bottom of the page that allow you to adjust the protocol image to align with the form fields such as rotate, move up, and move sideways.

        If you do have questions or ideas to improve the form, please contact us so we can improve it. Please send us a message on our Facebook page at:

        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JumpStartGeorgia/">https://www.facebook.com/JumpStartGeorgia/</a>

        And again, thank you!

        Sincerely,

        The JumpStart Team
