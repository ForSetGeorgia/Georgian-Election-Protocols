      app_description: As a civic tech organization, JumpStart often tries to find solutions to these sorts of transparency shortcomings and we often use technology to do it. This year, JumpStart is building a web-based tool that enables anyone to help us take the precinct information, which is uploaded to the CEC's website in the form of scanned documents, and digitize it so that organizations can then analyze it in time to have an impact - before the outcome of the elections has been decided. With the support of the National Democratic Institute and volunteers in Georgia and all over the world, JumpStart is spearheading a massive effort to digitize all the precinct information within 48 hours after polling stations close.
