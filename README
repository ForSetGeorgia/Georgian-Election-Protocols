# Georgia Election Protocols

## Local Majoritarian Elections
These elections have an extra layer of complexity. In addition to the district and precinct, there is now a majoritarian district in between the district and precinct. The ID of this district is of a different format: district_id.majoritarian_id, i.e., 01.02. It is also possible for there to be a sub-majoritarian district so in this case the ID will be 01.01.01.

This majoritarian ID is only needed for generating the data for the election data site. For this site, everything is still tied to the district and precinct which still works with local majoritarian elections.

## Databases
The protocols app uses two database: one to store the data entry records and one that summarizes all of the results for analysis. This means two databases need to be created and the user that has access to the first database also needs access to the second.

The second database name is hardcoded and should be called protocol_analysis.

You will need to grant access to this second database and make sure you include the ability to 'create view'.
GRANT select, insert, update, delete, create, alter, index, drop, create view, references ON `protocol_analysis`.* TO `username`@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';



# TODO
* add scraper to get the data from CEC so it is possible to compare their party counts to ours
* add ability to flag unusual supplementary documents (i.e., too tired, singing, etc)
